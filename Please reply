Hello Chris,

I couldn't find any other way to try and contact you, so here goes nothing.
I'm using your code for private usage and i must say i'm really happy you shared it.

The only thing i want to ask is if its possible to make the files in the 'images' folder STOP from playing randomly. Is there any chance you
can help me with this?!

That would be amazing!


Best regards,
